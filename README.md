Not exactly the smartest thing to implement - any dashboarding tool on top of OHLC datasets would be much-much-much better.  Only that as of now I neither have a dashboarding tool that can run Python (like Periscope Data) nor publicly available OHLC datasets

## Install

```bash
pip install .
```

## Use

See `display-intristic --help`
